## Rules
### Board changing
- [ ] Infinite board (on some dimensions)

- [ ] Moving platforms
- [ ] Hexagonal/Triangular tiles
- [ ] 3D with terrain
- [ ] Tiles are damaged when moved on, and destroyed after x times damaged
- [ ] Tiles that contain a small chess board
- [ ] Tiles that contain the board itself (going out of the board just makes you end up near that tile)
- [ ] Terrain tiles like plain, forest, mountain, desert, river, etc. that influences pieces moves and abilities
- [ ] Second board in some parallel world (with some mechanics to send pieces between the two)
